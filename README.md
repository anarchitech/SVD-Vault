# SVD-Vault

We needed a single place to stash svd's; some of us are rendering them with [The Equatesinator](https://github.com/anarchitech/equatesinator),
some need to grab them for use with Thomas Roth's excellent [SVD-Loader script](https://github.com/leveldown-security/SVD-Loader-Ghidra) for [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org).
[Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org) is great; we also use [radare](https://radare.org) and highly recommend it as well.

[tinygo-org](https://github.com/tinygo-org/stm32-svd) has a nice collection of patched svd's for the stm32 microcontroller family.
